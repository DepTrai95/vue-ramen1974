# Ramen1974

This is a simple ramen restaurant website Rebuild, which is built using Vue 3 with Vite and plain CSS/SCSS. Reason for the rebuild is, the project was a WordPress project before with extremely low performance, it took 3s previously to load the page, the lighthouse-score was also low, especially the performance was at ~50-ish. This rebuild scores a perfect 100 in each relevant category on desktop and almost 100 on mobile.

This project was generated and is powered by [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Prerequisites

To build/run this project locally, nvm, npm and Node v18+ are required.

- If not already installed, install nvm on your machine from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You can check whether nvm is installed in your terminal with `nvm -v`.
- If it is not already the standard-version - install Node v18 with `nvm install 18`. You can check whether the right Node version is selected with `node -v`. If a different Node version is selected, use `nvm use 18`.
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install project dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running the project locally
